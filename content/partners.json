      "SMARTfit Cognitive-Motor Dual-Task Training (CMDT) helps create and strengthen neural pathways so you can make quicker, smarter decisions, plan and problem solve while moving, execute combined cognitive and motor skills more efficiently, and process what you see faster so you can react faster.",
      "SMARTfit uniquely excels at challenging the Executive Function domain of the brain through top-down processing. Make quicker and better decisions, solve problems, improve working memory, and enhance cognitive flexibility. All this happens while performing a variety of physical movements and tasks, simulating real life.",
      "It's this combination of reaction and executive function training that studies reveal leads to greater transference to real-world results than reaction training alone. SMARTfit's gamified dual-task programming delivers rapid transference to real life performance for all ages, abilities, and stages of life - from athletic performance and youth programs to active aging, rehabilitation, and chronic condition management."

      "Awaken Blue is a lighting consultancy firm that provides research-backed, bio-centric lighting solutions for commercial settings, including senior care facilities. Our services involve designing and specifying circadian lighting systems for projects to improve the health and productivity of a building's occupants.",
      "The concept of circadian lighting draws on scientific principles showing that correctly timed exposure to blue-enriched light can positively influence the circadian rhythms of older adults. Research indicates that older adults often have disrupted sleep patterns due to age-related changes in their vision and insufficient exposure to natural daylight.",
      "Our solutions feature morning blue-enriched white light that mimics bright natural sunlight and helps suppress the sleep hormone melatonin, increasing alertness, improving mood, and strengthening the sleep-wake cycle. Evening warm-toned and dim lighting avoids blue light in the evening hours to prevent melatonin suppression and promote relaxation.",
      "Implementing innovative circadian lighting offers proven benefits for seniors including improved sleep patterns with earlier bedtimes and less fragmented sleep, enhanced mood and cognitive function through boosted serotonin levels, reduced dementia-related behavioral symptoms like sundowning, and minimized fall risks through improved alertness and visibility. Our systems are being successfully adopted in assisted living, memory care, hospitals, nursing homes, and at-home solutions for independent-living seniors."
